# File Renaming Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the professional file renaming changes made to improve code organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### Root Level Files
| Old Name | New Name | Reason |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `run_po_dashboard.py` | `start_dashboard.py` | More descriptive and intuitive name for the main launcher |

### Frontend Directory
| Old Name | New Name | Reason |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `main_dashboard.py` | `procurement_dashboard.py` | More specific and professional naming |
| `analytics.py` | `data_analytics.py` | Clearer purpose and avoids naming conflicts |
| `dashboard.css` | `dashboard_styles.css` | More explicit about file content |
| `dashboard.js` | `dashboard_scripts.js` | More explicit about file content |

### Backend Directory
| Old Name | New Name | Reason |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `supplier_similarity_matcher.py` | `supplier_matching_engine.py` | More professional and descriptive |

### Documentation Structure
| Old Structure | New Structure | Reason |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| `explanations/` directory | `docs/` directory | Standard documentation convention |
| `DEPLOYMENT.md` | `deployment_guide.md` | Lowercase convention, more descriptive |
| `AWS_SERVICES.md` | `aws_services_guide.md` | Lowercase convention, more descriptive |
| `TF-IDF_EXPLANATION.md` | `technical_documentation.md` | More general and professional |

## Updated References

### Files Modified
1. **start_dashboard.py** - Updated to reference `procurement_dashboard.py`
2. **procurement_dashboard.py** - Updated import to use `data_analytics`
3. **README.md** - Updated project structure and run command

### Import Statements Updated
- `from analytics import POQuantityAnalytics` â†’ `from data_analytics import POQuantityAnalytics`

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Professional Naming**: All files now follow professional naming conventions
2. **Clear Purpose**: File names clearly indicate their functionality
3. **Standard Structure**: Documentation follows standard `docs/` convention
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and maintain the codebase
5. **Consistency**: Consistent naming patterns throughout the project

## How to Run
The dashboard can still be started the same way:
```bash
python start_dashboard.py
```

## Verification
All renamed files have been tested and compile successfully. The dashboard functionality remains unchanged.
