## What This Dashboard Does

This project demonstrates how AI can solve real-world procurement challenges by:

1. **Analyzing Current State**: Shows exactly where your organization stands (16.3% of POs go to small businesses)
2. **Identifying the Gap**: Calculates precisely what's needed to reach the 25% target (110 more POs)
3. **AI-Powered Matching**: Uses machine learning to find the best supplier transition opportunities
4. **Strategic Planning**: Provides phased implementation plans with confidence levels
5. **Interactive Visualization**: Presents complex data through charts, tables, and metrics

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you'll need:

### 1. Python Installation
- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your computer
- You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. Required Python Packages
Install the necessary packages by running this command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install streamlit plotly pandas numpy scikit-learn pathlib
```

### 3. Project Files
- Download or clone this repository to your computer
- Ensure all CSV data files are in the `backend/` directory

## Understanding the Project

### Key Components

**Streamlit**: A Python framework that turns data scripts into interactive web applications. Think of it as a way to create professional dashboards without complex web development.

**Machine Learning**: The project uses similarity algorithms to match current suppliers with potential small business alternatives based on their services and characteristics.

**Data Analytics**: Processes procurement data to identify patterns, calculate gaps, and recommend optimal transition strategies.

**Interactive Visualization**: Uses Plotly charts and tables to make complex procurement data easy to understand and actionable.

### The Main Features Explained

#### 1. **Current State Analysis**
Shows exactly where your organization stands:
- Current percentage of POs going to small businesses (16.3%)
- Total PO counts and breakdowns
- Visual comparison with the 25% target

#### 2. **AI-Powered Gap Analysis**
Calculates precisely what's needed:
- Exact number of POs to transition (110)
- Identifies which current suppliers have the most transition opportunities
- Provides confidence levels for different scenarios

#### 3. **Smart Supplier Matching**
Uses machine learning to find the best matches:
- Analyzes supplier descriptions and services
- Calculates similarity scores between current and small business suppliers
- Ranks opportunities by feasibility and impact

#### 4. **Strategic Implementation Planning**
Provides actionable roadmaps:
- Phased approach with different confidence thresholds
- Quick wins for immediate impact
- Long-term strategy for sustainable growth

## How to Run the Dashboard

1. **Navigate to your project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/supplier-diversity
   ```

2. **Run the dashboard**:
   ```bash
   python run_po_dashboard.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser** to: http://localhost:8503

4. **Explore the dashboard**:
   - Use the navigation buttons (Dashboard, Settings, About)
   - Toggle between light and dark themes
   - Scroll through different analytics sections

## Customizing the Dashboard

### Try Different Scenarios
You can modify the target percentage or explore different matching thresholds:
```python
# In po_quantity_analytics.py, change the target:
self.target_percentage = 30.0  # Try 30% instead of 25%
```

### Understanding the Algorithms
The project uses several AI techniques:
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts supplier descriptions into numerical data
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures how similar two suppliers are
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Finds the best combination of transitions

### Adding New Data
To analyze your own procurement data:
1. Format your data to match the expected CSV structure
2. Place files in the `backend/` directory
3. Update file paths in the analytics modules

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Module not found" errors
Install missing packages:
```bash
pip install [package-name]
```

### "File not found" errors
Ensure all CSV files are in the correct `backend/` directory structure.

### Dashboard won't load
Check that port 8503 isn't already in use:
```bash
pkill -f streamlit
python run_po_dashboard.py
```

### Data doesn't display
Verify your CSV files have the expected column names and data format.

## Important Notes

- **Data Privacy**: All analysis is performed locally on your machine
- **Scalability**: The dashboard can handle datasets with thousands of suppliers and POs
- **Customization**: Colors, themes, and layouts can be modified in the CSS sections
- **Performance**: Large datasets may take a few moments to process initially

## Understanding the Results

### Similarity Scores
- **0.4+ (High Confidence)**: Very similar suppliers, low risk transitions
- **0.2-0.4 (Medium Confidence)**: Moderately similar, may need evaluation
- **<0.2 (Low Confidence)**: Different suppliers, higher risk transitions

### Implementation Strategy
- Start with high confidence matches for quick wins
- Gradually expand to medium confidence matches
- Use the phased approach to minimize disruption
