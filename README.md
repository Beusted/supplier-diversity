## Overview
Duckling Dashboard is an innovative AI-powered dashboard designed to help organizations achieve their small business procurement goals. It leverages machine learning algorithms and data analytics to analyze current procurement patterns, identify gaps, and provide actionable recommendations for transitioning purchase orders to small businesses. 

The dashboard specifically focuses on reaching the 25% small business procurement target through data-driven insights and strategic planning.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Supplier Matching**: Uses machine learning algorithms to identify optimal supplier transition opportunities based on similarity analysis.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Comprehensive dashboard showing current procurement status (16.3% of POs to small businesses) versus the 25% target.
- **Strategic Planning Tools**: Provides phased implementation plans with confidence levels and timeline recommendations.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Dynamic charts, tables, and metrics that adapt to light/dark themes for optimal user experience.
- **Gap Analysis**: Calculates precise requirements (110 POs need transition) and provides actionable roadmaps.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **User Interface**: Streamlit
- **Data Storage/Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity), Amazon Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 3.5)
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Interactive Charts

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit plotly pandas numpy scikit-learn pathlib
   ```
3. Run the dashboard:
   ```bash
   python run_po_dashboard.py
   ```
5. Access the dashboard via http://localhost:8503

## Usage
- Navigate through different sections using the top navigation bar and toggle between light and dark themes.
- Explore various analytics sections including current state analysis, transition scenarios, and implementation planning.
- Review detailed supplier matching recommendations and quick wins for immediate impact.
- Use the phased implementation plan to develop a strategic roadmap for achieving the 25% target.

## Customization
- The dashboard primarily targets a 25% small business procurement goal, but this can be modified in `po_quantity_analytics.py`.
- To adjust similarity thresholds or matching algorithms, modify the parameters in the supplier matching functions.
- Color themes and styling can be customized through the CSS variables in the dashboard file.
- Data sources can be updated by replacing CSV files in the `backend/` directory with your organization's procurement data.

## Project Impact
This dashboard demonstrates practical applications of AI in procurement by:
- Automating supplier research and matching processes
- Providing data-driven insights for strategic decision making
- Supporting small business growth through improved procurement opportunities
- Showcasing how machine learning can solve real-world business challenges
