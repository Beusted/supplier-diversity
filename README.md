# Small Business Supplier Diversity Dashboard

## Overview
The Small Business Supplier Diversity Dashboard is an innovative AI-powered analytics platform designed to help organizations achieve their small business procurement goals. It leverages machine learning algorithms and data analytics to analyze current procurement patterns, identify gaps, and provide actionable recommendations for transitioning purchase orders to small businesses. The dashboard specifically focuses on reaching the 25% small business procurement target through data-driven insights and strategic planning.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Supplier Matching**: Uses machine learning algorithms to identify optimal supplier transition opportunities based on similarity analysis.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Comprehensive dashboard showing current procurement status (16.3% of POs to small businesses) versus the 25% target.
- **Strategic Planning Tools**: Provides phased implementation plans with confidence levels and timeline recommendations.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Dynamic charts, tables, and metrics that adapt to light/dark themes for optimal user experience.
- **Gap Analysis**: Calculates precise requirements (110 POs need transition) and provides actionable roadmaps.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Streamlit
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Interactive Charts
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Cal Poly branding

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit plotly pandas numpy scikit-learn pathlib
   ```
3. Ensure all CSV data files are present in the `backend/` directory.
4. Run the dashboard:
   ```bash
   python run_po_dashboard.py
   ```
5. Access the dashboard via http://localhost:8503
